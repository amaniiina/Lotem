# **About the organization**

* Lotem - A Gender Counter-terrorism Unit - unites feminist women across the country who are interested in feminist activism against sexual and gender violence.
* Lotem's primary goal is to be an effective feminist organizing platform for non-violent direct actions (NVDA), with the aim of raising issues of sexual violence, gender violence and the inclusion of women on the agenda, to attract media and public attention, and to channel public pressure on elected officials and decision-making positions. Their actions are based on freedom of expression and artistic representations in the public sphere. Their secondary purpose is to make radical feminist activism accessible to all people while sharing knowledge and creating an activist community.

# **About the project**
This project aims to build an application in order to help solidify Lotem's activist community. It is a group chatting and events management application; in which the majority of group creation and event posting work is automated. Events will be displayed on a calendar either by city or the whole country, and there will be the option of organizing national events. There will also be the possibility of requesting donations or resources, donating and volunteering.
